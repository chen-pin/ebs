# Scope
**10/28/21**: coming soon with target accessibility

This directory contains some figures related with the results for 
  reflected light exoplanets. This output is optional. 
  The bar plot is equivalent to the output stored in `output/csv/`.
  It uses the same information [output/csv/README](../csv/README.md), 
  and adds the estimated duration of the observation taking into account
  the observing scenario in the Roman Coronagraph. 
  See [`json/README`](../../json/README.md) for the available options, and 
`scripts/cgi_etc_rv_shortest_integration_time.py` 
  for more information.
