# Scope

This directory contains two output directories:

- `csv/`: it contains the CSV files with the results of the integration times
and the accessibility of each target.
  [README](csv/README.md)

- `figures/`: in the case of reflected light planets, there is an optional
figure that is stored in this directory. [README](figures/README.md)
