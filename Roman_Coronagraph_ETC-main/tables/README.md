# Scope

This directory contains a set of CSV files with detailed information about
    the instrumental performance of the Roman coronagraph based on instrument
    requirements, simulations and some laboratory measurements. The values
    represent current best estimates (CBE) for those parameters that are
    used by the exposure time calculator (the specific methods may be found in 
  [EXOSIMS](https://github.com/dsavransky/EXOSIMS)).

These set of values will be reviewed during 2022 and beyond, while several
  ground tests will be conducted. 

The user should not change any of these values, because the results would
not represent the performance of the Roman coronagraph. 

More information about the options of the instrumental performance that
  the user is able to choose are given in [json/README](../json/README.md)
