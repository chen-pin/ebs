# Scope

This directory is only used to store temporary files that update 
  [EXOSIMS](https://github.com/dsavransky/EXOSIMS) objects.
    These files are written during the runs of the Exposure Time Calculator
    and are automatically deleted once the
    run is over. Sometimes, if the code stops for any reason, the files 
    may not get deleted.
    Feel free to delete them at any time
    when the Roman Coronagraph ETC is not running.
