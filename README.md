# The Error Budget Software (EBS)  
The Error Budget Software (EBS) package is an error-budgeting toolkit to aid the user in exploring combinations of technology performance parameters that can enable observations of Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of nearby stars ("exoEarths") using a telescope combined with a coronagraph instrument.  EBS accepts key parameters of a space observatory and coronagraph instrument that impact the system's ability to detect exoEarths, and it returns the required exposure time to reach user-specified SNR for the given target star; since any mission has a limited total amount of observation time, one can think of exposure time per target as a key cost quantity on mission science return.  EBS also returns count rates of signal and noise sources.  The computation uses the methodology described in Nemati et al. [DOI: 10.1117/1.JATIS.6.3.039002], which involves allocating flux-ratio noise among different system elements. Written in Python, EBS is essentially a wrapper around the open-source EXOSIMS package (https://exosims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  EBS enables the user to input parameters specifying dynamical wavefront aberrations (from the observatory to the coronagraph instrument) and parameters representing performance of a wavefront-sensing-and-control (WFS&C) subsystem; these are FREAK's distinctive features.  
## For Developers
* Please use Git branching for code development to keep the main branch in a working state (ref. [Git Feature-Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)).
